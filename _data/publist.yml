  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moir√© lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

- title: "Direct evidence for Cooper pairing without a spectral gap in a disordered superconductor above Tc"

  description: We use our atomic-scale scanning tunneling noise setup on a disordered superconductor, and discover a state above TC that, much like an ordinary metal, has no (pseudo)gap, but carries charge via paired electrons.
